# JCAP Issue Guidelines

These are the guidelines that should be followed when creating a new issue for JCAP.

## Title and Content

The title and content of your issue should follow the same best practices as commit messages: the title should be short and to the most direct point, and the content should be an extended description containing any supporting information necessary.

## Bug reports:

If submitting a bug report, please include the system or subsystem (e.g. video (render or display), input, sound, etc.) that appears to be the source along with the explicit steps to recreate the bug.

## Enhancement/research/features

Proposals for additional enhancements or features are always welcome, just make sure you're thorough with your explanation/description. Pull requests however are always the most expeditious avenue for adding a new feature.
